# UltimMC Fixed

## This is a "cracked" and fixed version of a popular Minecraft launcher that lets you play the game without a Microsoft account

## Pre-built binaries

Please check the **"Release"** page of github to get the **pre-built binaries**

## How to install and use

1. Download pre-built binaries for your system.
2. Unpack them in your desired directory.
3. Launch `UltimMC`.
4. Go to account settings, and you will be requested to use an email and password.
5. As your email use your username, and then type a random password or use an Ely.by account.
6. Save it.
7. Now enjoy the Launcher.

In the case you're using macOS or Linux then another additional step is to make `UltimMC` an executable by running the command `chmod +x UltimMC.app/Contents/MacOS/UltimMC` in the terminal.

To remove "localhost:nnnn" or "Ely.by" from the Minecraft main menu and F3, add `-Dauthlibinjector.noShowServerName` to the Java arguments in the UltimMC settings.
